# Learning-Resources

At the February PyAtl meetup I did a lightning talk about "educational resources".  I've noticed at those meetings that many attendees are just starting their journeys in programming.  At one point I was "self-taught".  I hate that phrase because learning is fully up to you.  Eventually, I "self taught" my way to a Master degree in CS and a job as a Software Engineer.  I still "self-teach" everyday with the help of my colleagues and AI chat bots.  I digress...

## CS50
Harvard collaborates with edX to offer this freshman level introduction to computer science.  This will teach you the fundamentals of computer science.  You'll learn how computers work.  Then you'll learn how to control the with a low level language like C.  You progress quickly to "higher level" concepts and languages.  You'll get a taste of networking, algorithm design/analysis and data structures.  Eventually you'll use Python. (This course has changed over the years and they now have many "flavors" and follow-up courses.  You can audit for free but I like to have some skin in the game and paid the money for the certificate.

## Boot.dev
I've recently found boot.dev.  I signed up to learn Go, but while I was there I took a few other courses.  There is a lot of practical lessons that you need to be a software engineer.  In fact, although I use some of these technologies daily/weekly at work I never actually took the time to learn the basics.  I just hacked things together or templated off other peoples previous work.  Going through some of these really helped me understand things like Docker.  They have an intro Python course which I didn't take, but I'm sure it's as good as the others.  It also has a great "gamification" system that encourages you to stay active in learning every day.

## MIT: Missing Semester
If you have a formal CS education that's great... but when you start your first day a Software Engineer you won't know what the hell you're doing.  MIT's missing semester can help.  It's practical lessons about how to get work done.  You'll learn some basics on the command line and learn how git works.  You also learn how to exit VIM!!!

## Scrimba
I found on Reddit that the best React course is on Scrimba.  Scrimba has lots of interactive courses.  A code editor and video player are kind of merged together.  The instructor walks you through things in a video and then the video turns into an IDE where you do some work, submit and continue.  It's mostly front-end stuff... but have a look at:

## DataQuest & DataCamp
Both of these I've used.  They're similar.  They have lots of data science type tutorials.

## So many Others
I took this series on Coursera when Coursera was relatively new.  It may have been free at the time.  In the middle section of the series I remember building an Asteroids game.  You fly a small spaceship around dodging and blasting rocks.  It was a great way to learn Object Oriented Programming.

You can find lots of recommendations online for good courses.  The trick is, pick one and stick to it.  Though it's tempting to just do the free stuff I think generally paying $50 to $200 is well worth it to jumpstart the journey.

## Geogia Tech Master's Degrees
I'll shamelessly plug GaTech OMSCS.  This is a very affordable program.  It's selecitive but they try to let in as many people as possible who they thing can succeeed.  The whole program can be done for less than $10k.  It's 10 courses.  It took me 10 semesters (3.3 years).  It is difficult.  Don't let the "online" part fool you.  But, if you like learning and want to bolster your fundamentals, it can be worth it.

The also now have simliar programs for "Analytics" OMSA and Cyber Security.  Maybe more...  There is some overlap in courses but the programs are separate and costs are different.

The Reddit for OMSCS has lots of people willing to help and encourage:

## Raspberry Pi
Get a Raspberry Pi and make some stuff.  It's great fun.
